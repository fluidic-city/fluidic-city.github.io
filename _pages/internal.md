        <p><strong>Become a good researcher</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Most importantly: read many papers and excel at math and programming.</li>
        <li>Keep up with the latest research
            <ul>
            <li>follow influential researchers/groups</li>
            <li>read papers at top-tier venues</li>
            <li>attend talks</li>
            <li>talk to experts</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Employ critical thinking
            <ul>
            <li>what has been done</li>
            <li>why certain phenomena happen</li>
            <li>what are the next steps</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Keep a research log on experimental progress, document successes and failures.</li>
        <li>Practice quantitative data analysis (statistics) and qualitative data analysis (visualization).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Become a good researcher in a pack (collaboration)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Be respectful, responsible, and professional.</li>
        <li>Understand others' motivations and incentives.</li>
        <li>Be open-minded to others' topics, thoughts, and approaches.</li>
        <li>If you do small tasks well, people will offer you big opportunities.</li>
        <li>Endorse people when you can; being endorsed by an influential person can help you go a long way.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Research process</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Inspiration → Hypothesis → Experiments → Results → Write-up → Release code/data</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Analyze a problem</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Has this problem been addressed before? (The answer is probably yes to some degree).</li>
        <li>What are the shortcomings of existing methods?</li>
        <li>What's your approach? Does it improve the state-of-the-art?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Set up a plan</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Solving a problem takes time, you need a plan with weekly and monthly goals. Once you have a plan, stick to it.</li>
        <li>Don't compromise unless some serious limitations are found. Always push the quality of your project to your limit.</li>
        <li>Always tackle the core problem first, no matter how difficult it is.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Implement an approach</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Always try to find existing code. If you cannot find any, contact the authors of the approach (paper) telling them how much you admire their work and would like to try an experiment with their code (and data). It's unnecessary to mention your project.</li>
        <li>Implement an approach from scratch as your last resort: it takes a lot of efforts and it's difficult to ensure the correctness.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Research buddy</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Meet with a friend regularly to review your progress.</li>
        <li>Explain your approach to your friend is the best way to organize your thoughts.</li>
        <li>Discuss the next steps with your friend always results in better solutions.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="literature-review">
        <h2 id="literature-review">Literature review</h2>
        <p>The goal of literature review is two-fold. First, it solidifies the novelty and significance of your project. Second, when you write, it shows that you know your area. Both elements are essential for a good paper.</p>

        <p><strong>Specific guidelines</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Review at least 30–50 papers</li>
        <li>Search keywords in Google Scholar</li>
        <li>Search keywords in your targeting venue (if you exclude previous work published in your targeting venue, you will be deemed as ignorant).</li>
        <li>Use directly relevant papers as pivots. Search papers that cite these papers and go through the reference sections of these papers. You can ask experts for pivot papers.</li>
        <li>For the first-round review, don't read every paper in detail. Read the title and the abstract, if relevant, read the introduction and conclusion, if still interesting, mark it as important.</li>
        <li>For the second-round review, try to understand the details of important papers found in the first-round review.</li>
        <li>It's also helpful to keep a reading journal.
            <ul>
            <li>What is the paper's motivation? Why the problem is interesting?</li>
            <li>What is the technique?</li>
            <li>Are there any proofs, can you work out them by yourself?</li>
            <li>What are the results? How are they evaluated?</li>
            <li>What are the core messages/key insights of the paper?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
