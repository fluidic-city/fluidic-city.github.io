Search papers that cite these papers and go through the reference sections of these papers. You can ask experts for pivot papers.</li> <li>For the first-round review, don't read every paper in detail. Read the title and the abstract, if relevant, read the introduction and conclusion, if still interesting, mark it as important.</li> <li>For the second-round review, try to understand the details of important papers found in the first-round review.</li> <li>It's also helpful to keep a reading journal. <ul> <li>What is the paper's motivation? Why the problem is interesting?</li> <li>What is the technique?</li> <li>Are there any proofs, can you work out them by yourself?</li> <li>What are the results?

Our department considers 40 and above as "high". However, don't take the numbers too seriously. H-index is calculated based on citations, which usually correlate with a venue's size. A small and high-quality conference could have a much lower h-index than a large but mediocre conference.</p> <p>The submission deadline is just a rough estimate.

Here are some guidelines and suggestions for preparing your slides and talk.</p> <p><strong>Treat your talk seriously</strong></p> <ul> <li>Your talk may be the only chance for people to put your name, face, and work together. Academia is a small world and you'd want the community to know you in the best way possible.</li> <li>More importantly, think about how many directly relevant papers of your project are out there? When you present at a top-tier conference, guess what, the authors of those papers are likely sitting in the audience. And you want to make a good impression since they are going to review your papers, write your reference letters (even tenure letters), assess your proposals, and refer you to jobs.</li> <li>The goal of your talk is to excite the audience so that they are eager to talk to you and follow up on your work. The best way to impress is to inform. Instead of saying your work is the best, tell people something that they don't know. People will feel their time is worthwhile when they learn something new and important.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Prepare the slides</strong></p> <ul> <li>People can only do one thing: listen to you or read your slides. So, your speech and slides should complement each other NOT overlap with each other. This means you should not prepare your slides like lecture notes and, even worse, read them.</li> <li>Everything you put on your slides (text, figures, …) should be visible. Things that can't be seen are useless. The recommended font size is 24+; the minimum font size should be 20.</li> <li>Place page numbers at the top right corner instead of the bottom right corner to reduce the chance of blocking them.</li> <li>Avoid long sentences, use short phrases instead. Incomplete sentences are totally fine.</li> <li>Avoid animated transitions: academia appreciates sharp presentations.</li> <li>Only one slide should be titled "conclusion", use "summary" for other sections at the most.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Content of your slides</strong></p> <ul> <li>Motivation (20%), key idea/approach (80%)</li> <li>You must identify a key idea. After the motivation, cut to the chase by talking about the key idea; organize your slides around this idea (prune material that is irrelevant to this idea). It's fine to cover just part of your work.</li> <li>Avoid shallow overviews at all costs. Be absolutely specific about each point and don't leave the audience to figure it out.</li> <li>The best way to explain your idea/approach is to use a simple and intuitive example.</li> <li>People appreciate honesty: make sure to discuss the limitations of your idea/approach.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Speech</strong></p> <ul> <li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&amp;list=PLUl4u3cNGP60eUvXa1jfVT9BsBsqAICr_" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">How To Speak by Prof. Winston</a> </li> <li>Your stance is part of the impression and thus important. Don't move or wobble too much. It gives people a hard time tracking you.</li> <li>You will have two minutes to engage your audience before they fall asleep. Within two minutes, you'd want to address the following items. <ul> <li>What is the problem?</li> <li>Why is it significant and interesting? (when the topic involves the suffering of other people, show empathy).</li> <li>Is your approach a worthwhile advance?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Show enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is impactful and contagious.</li> <li>If you feel nervous, take a deep breath and move around before your talk.</li> <li>Don't startle in the beginning of your talk, which will make you look unconfident. Script the first few sentences precisely.</li> <li>Don't start with a joke or apologize for not preparing the slides well.</li> <li>Identify nodders and speak to them.</li> <li>Pausing is OK, but don't pause too often.</li> <li>Be specific about the places of your contents when referring to them. Don't just point at a distance. It's difficult to construct that "invisible line" from your fingertip to the content.</li> <li>The audience will "shut down" when your time is up. Continuing is VERY counterproductive. Simply truncate and conclude. Never ask "would you like me to go on".</li> <li>Questions are not an issue but a GOLDEN opportunity for you to connect with the audience. So, pause briefly now and then to encourage questions. If you don't know the answers, just admit it, and ask for pointers afterward.</li> </ul> <p>(<a href="#">Top</a>)</p> </section> <br> <hr> <br> <section id="after-a-paper-gets-accepted"> <h2 id="after-a-paper-gets-accepted">After a paper gets accepted</h2> <p>Congratulations on your paper acceptance! You've done the heavy lifting. Here are the next steps.</p> <p><strong>Prepare the final (camera-ready) version</strong></p> <ul> <li>Address all comments of the reviewers by highlighting (color-coding) the changes. If you have questions, let's discuss. Once you are done, let me know and I'll do a pass of the paper.</li> <li>[optional but highly recommended] Acknowledge people who kindly shared the code and/or data with you, and consider citing their papers as a good gesture.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Watch for deadlines</strong></p> <ul> <li>Make sure to submit all required files (final paper, final video, etc.) by their deadlines.</li> <li>Update arXiv if your paper is posted there.</li> <li>Keep track of other deadlines such as the conference registration. We want to register the conference as early as possible, which is usually cheaper.</li> <li>Travel itinerary can be decided later but not too late. Three months prior to the conference is a good time to start booking the travel. See `Attending a conference` section.</li> </ul> <br> <p>For more information on how to <strong>Release code and data</strong> and <strong>Add a paper to the website</strong>, see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wyx0pm6otuy1su2brze26/Updating-the-Lab-Website.paper?rlkey=atj2duxu7xt5970wjonfl9qg6&amp;dl=0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Updating the Lab Website</a>.</p> <p>(<a href="#">Top</a>)</p> </section> <br> <hr> <br> <section id="attending-a-conference"> <h2 id="attending-a-conference">Attending a conference</h2> <p>Travel is exciting. Travel with expenses covered is even better! Here are some items going to be covered for your conference travel:</p> <ul> <li>Conference registration and publication fees</li> <li>Airline ticket</li> <li>Hotel (if the destination city is expensive, you may need to share a room)</li> <li>Meals</li> </ul> <p>The hotel and meals will be covered at the most from one day prior to the conference to one day after the conference (department rules). The meals will be reimbursed at predetermined rates (so you don't need to keep the receipts). Other costs such as getting a visa and traveling to nearby attractions are at your own expense. The department understands that our students can't afford to pay for the costs first and get reimbursed later. So, we will try to book many things for you. Meals may be the only thing that requires reimbursement after your travel.</p> <p>Conference is more about networking than research. Go talk to people and make friends! Conference is also a good opportunity to connect with the industry. Many companies will advertise their openings at a conference.</p> <p>CS conferences are usually laid-back.
